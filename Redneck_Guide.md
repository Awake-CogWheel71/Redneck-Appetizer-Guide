# NOTICE OF CLASSIFICATION
The information contained herein is intended for operators of 4x4 vehicles, amateur radio enthusiasts, musicians, and Rednecks. Unauthorized distribution to "Health Nut" agencies is strictly prohibited.

# 1.0 THE PHILOSOPHY: "FANCY IS A STATE OF MIND"
An hors d'oeuvre in this guide is defined not by the clock, but by utility.
* **The Golden Rule:** If it requires a fork, it's a meal. If it requires a toothpick or a sturdy thumb, it's an hors d'oeuvre.
* **The Presentation:** Swap silver platters for a clean tailgate, a sanded-down circular saw blade, or a hubcap from a '95 Wrangler.

# 2.0 CATEGORIZATION OF DELICACIES
| French Term | Redneck Translation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Charcuterie** | Summer sausage and sharp cheddar sliced with a pocketknife. |
| **Canapés** | Ritz crackers topped with easy-cheese and a single pickled jalapeño slice. |
| **Crudités** | A bag of baby carrots and a tub of Ranch dressing. |
| **Amuse-bouche** | A single pork rind dipped in hot sauce to "wake grandma from a nap." |

# 3.0 TECHNICAL MANUAL: MODEL B-K/R1
**Subject:** High-Protein Cracker-Based Delivery System  
**Common Name:** The Bologna-Kraft Assembly  
**Revision:** 1.0.2 (Tailgate Edition)

## 3.1 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The B-K/R1 is a modular, handheld appetizer designed for rapid deployment in high-social environments. It utilizes a multi-layer composite structure to provide maximum caloric density with zero thermal requirements.

## 3.2 COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS
* **Substrate (The Base):** One (1) Circular Saltine or Buttery-Round cracker (Snap-Test >5 psi).
* **The Interface (Adhesive):** One (1) slice of Kraft Individual Wrapped Single (Yellow, 40-mesh).
* **The Core Processor:** One (1) slice of Oscar Mayer Bologna (Approx. 2mm thickness).
* **Optional Harmonic Filter:** One (1) dollop of Yellow Mustard (Oscilloscope-tested for acidity).

## 3.3 ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS (PROCEDURE)
1. **Pre-Processing:** Remove Kraft Single from sleeve. Use the "Quad-Fold" Method.
2. **Bologna Modification:** Use Method A (Pocketknife) or Method B (Bite-Trim) to match substrate circumference.
3. **Integration Stack:** Layer Bottom-Up: Substrate -> Bologna -> Kraft Quadrant -> Mustard Point-Source.

# 4.0 ADDITIONAL HARDWARE MODULES
* **4.1 The Southwestern Truffle:** Softened cream cheese core rolled in crushed Nacho Cheese Doritos.
* **4.2 The Deconstructed Jalapeño Popper:** Cream cheese smeared on a fresh jalapeño. 
* **4.3 Pigs in a "Snuggie":** Crescent rolls wrapped around venison jerky or breakfast sausage.
* **4.4 The Pascagoula Pearl:** Hard-boiled egg pickled for three fiscal quarters doused in Crystal Hot Sauce.

* **Sweet Tea:** The universal solvent.
* **The "Champagne of Beers":** Reserved for "fancy" crackers with seeds.

# 7.0 THE THEORY OF RANCH DRESSING (THE UNIVERSAL SOLVENT)
Ranch Dressing possesses a molecular structure that bonds with both "Garden-Grade" and "Deep-Fried" components. Standard dip-level is a 1:1 ratio.

# 8.0 FIELD MAINTENANCE & THERMAL MANAGEMENT
* **8.1 Humidity Protocols:** Keep crackers in polymer sleeve until deployment. If limp, warm on FT-710 heat-sink or piano amp.
* **8.2 Cooler Diagnostic Flowchart:** Check for solid ice. If none, ensure water is cold and submerge meats in watertight bags. If warm, relocate to indoor fridge.

# 9.0 TROUBLESHOOTING MATRIX
| Symptom | Probable Cause | Corrective Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structural Collapse** | Overloading of Mustard; Substrate fatigue | Reduce fluid intake; swap for fresh cracker. |
| **Signal Interference** | Bologna skin (red ring) still attached | Manual extraction of red ring before ingestion. |
| **Limp Substrate** | Humidity > 90% (Mississippi Summer) | Warm on FT-710 heat-sink or Jeep dash. |
| **Low Palatability** | Unit is too cold (Straight from cooler) | Warm in palm for 30s or near tube amp. |
